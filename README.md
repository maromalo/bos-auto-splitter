# BACK OF SPACE autosplitter for LiveSplit

Made for 0.495
## Features
- Can change between Full Run and IL (Individual Level/Region) mode
- Automatic start:
  - After resetting and finishing/skipping tutorial (**set your timer to start at 1.40s to count STS's intro**)
  - (IL) After entering a region
- Automatic split when finishing **any** region (so don't do the same twice)
- Automatic reset:
  - On factory reset
  - (IL) On entering main menu

***
Bugs and notes:
- (IL) starts on settings/system/stats/terminal
- full run starts _after_ STS intro, skipping 1.4s (doesn't it make more sense this way tho?)
- factory reset detection sometimes doesn't work for some reason
